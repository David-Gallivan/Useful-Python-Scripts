Fibonacci's Egyptian Fraction Expansion Algorithm

The ancient Egyptians did not have a convenient place-value
system like the ancient Babylonians, who used a base-60
cuneiform notation. The Egyptians preferred to write all their
fractions as sums of unital fractions (in modern terms, with 
a numerator of 1) rather than as vulgar fractions (with a
numerator greater than 1). This was in fact necessary because
their fractional notation was limited to a heiroglyph for 1/2,
a heiroglyph for 1/3, and so on; they did not write with
numerator and denominator as we do, or with place value and
a 'sexagesimal point' as the Babylonians did.

Fibonacci came up with a greedy algorithm to compute an
expansion of a vulgar fraction into a sum of perfect fractions.
This expansion is not unique; in fact, some of the results come
out differently than the specific expansions used by the
ancient Egyptians. Still, it gives an interesting historical
perspective to try his algorithm and see what the Egyptians
had to put up with!

This was inspired by an assignment in a History of Mathematics
course at UK.
